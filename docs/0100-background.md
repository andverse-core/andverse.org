Metaverse, a long-standing but little-known concept, breaks into the limelight in 2021. It is widely considered as a new generation of network platform after the Internet. The metaverse is not the next generation of the Internet, just as the Internet is not a 3G, 4G or 5G communications network.

Communication networks and telephones empowered offline retail, and the Internet, computers and smartphones empowered e-commerce, so the metaverse, along with new interactive experiences, will certainly empower new business forms. We will call this new business form in the metaverse the Metaverse Commerce Ecosystem.

The global Covid-19 pandemic that began in early 2020 has suddenly and profoundly changed the course of world civilization. Global transportation was blocked, social isolation was imposed, the physical space for people's activities was confined to their respective places of residence, and the adoption of online meetings, online social networking, telecommuting, and all sorts of networked solutions designed to replace the traditional ways of the physical world was being accelerated suddenly. Human society as a whole has been put on a high-speed train to digital existence.

This historical momentum bred and gave birth to the blockchain boom in the second half of 2020 and the first half of 2021. With Bitcoin entering the vision and portfolios of Wall Street institutions and public companies, an unprecedented boom in the Ethereum ecosystem, and a Cambrian Explosion in the NFT market that quickly became one of the hottest and most talked-about areas of innovation during this phase, blockchain gave authenticity, persistence and scarcity to the digital world, thus making a native digital economy possible. It is against this backdrop that the metaverse is rapidly emerging.

Since the 1980s, people have been thinking about what the next generation successor to the Internet would be. The term "metaverse" quickly replaced the term "cyberspace" as the buzzword for this future vision and concept. The term "metaverse" originally came from Neal Stephenson's 1992 science fiction novel "Snow Crash". The word metaverse is a combination of the prefix _meta-_ (beyond) and the stem _verse_ (universe). It is clear from the construction of the word that the concept of metaverse intends to paint a picture of a new generation of future web platforms, namely a perceptible virtual universe of persistent, shared, 3D virtual spaces linked together.

The metaverse is a fusion, the interfusion of a virtually augmented physical reality and a virtual space with physical persistence. The metaverse is not a single thing; it is the result of the ongoing convergence of many mutually independent tools, platforms, and worlds supported by shared infrastructure, standards, and protocols. The metaverse would be made up of the creative work of millions, or even tens of millions, of people, each of whom could add their own elements to it through artistic creation, content creation, program development, game design, and other ways of adding value. The metaverse economic system would be an unprecedented, massively participatory, and equitable economy in which all people could participate in making money and reaping the rewards.

According to Baszucki, CEO of Roblox, a gaming platform founded in 2004, a metaverse needs to have at least eight elements - identity, friends, immersion, low latency, diversity, anywhere, economic system and civilization. This means that people can achieve experiences close to or even beyond the real world through a "virtual identity" in a subspace.

The four technological cornerstones for building the metaverse are Blockchain, Game, Network, and Display. Blockchain technology provides the decentralized infrastructure, while DeFi and NFT enable the assetization and value transfer of virtual items in the metaverse. Games provide rich interactive content for the metaverse and enhance user interaction. Network and computing power developments guarantee a low-latency, near real-time transmission and communication experience. The development of display technologies, such as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), further enhances the immersion and experience of people participating in the metaverse. The metaverse is not just a game, but an organic fusion of the four elements of BAND. It will build a new world of the new generation of network platform after the Internet and migrate all the business models that happen on the Internet to the metaverse as it is.

## Internet

According to the 47th "Statistical Report on the Development Status of the Internet in China" released by the China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) in February 2021, the size of China's Internet users reached 989 million, an increase of 85.4 million from March 2020, and the Internet penetration rate reached 70.4%.

Also according to a related report from the World Economic Forum, China has made great strides by more than doubling its share of total retail sales from 2016 to 2020, growing from about 20% to 44%. China is leading the world in e-commerce development. Chinese e-commerce accounts for more than 50% of total global Internet retail sales.

In parallel with the further development of the Internet and the digitization of finance, e-commerce and trade on the Internet have become almost entirely dependent on financial institutions as trusted third parties to process electronic payments. While the system works well enough for most transactions, it still suffers from the weaknesses inherent in the trust-based model. Because online platforms and financial institutions act as credit intermediaries, they inevitably have to deal with some of the resulting problems, such as dispute mediation and transaction reversal. The need for trust proliferates when there is a possibility of reversal of a transaction. In order to deal with these issues, platforms and agencies need to collect privacy from many users that would not otherwise be required. The possibility of fraud creates a reliance on third parties, and there is no mechanism for making payments over communication channels without resorting to trusted third parties.

## Blockchain

On October 31, 2008, a man who goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto published "Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System", proposing a solution to the above problem. In his paper, he called this solution Bitcoin. on January 3, 2009, with the launch of the main Bitcoin network, an epoch-making industry was born. That industry is today's blockchain industry.

Between 2013 and 2014, Russian-Canadian programmer Vitalik Buterin, an active member of the Bitcoin community, was inspired by Bitcoin to develop a vision for a "next-generation cryptocurrency and decentralized application platform". On July 30, 2015, the first version of Ethereum, codenamed "Frontier", was launched online

## NFT

In June 2017, Larva Labs, an America-based studio, launched a blockchain art collectible project called CryptoPunks. The project placed a total of 10,000 carefully designed, distinctive pixelated avatars, each of which is verified by a unique, persistent and indelible Token (token, pass) on the Ethereum blockchain, for free to the Ethereum community. This non-homogeneous, non-interchangeable and unique blockchain pass is the NFT (Non-Fungible Token), as it has come to be known. At that time, the concept of NFT had not yet been invented, and the standard of NFT had not yet been developed and published.

In January 2018, OpenSea, currently the world's largest marketplace for NFT crypto art collectibles, was launched. It has the widest range of categories, the largest number of transferable digital collections, and the best prices. in mid-March 2021, OpenSea closed a $23 million Series A round led by a16z. a16z believes that OpenSea provides a link between the consumer and infrastructure layers of the digital commodity economy, and is an important public facility in this new world of digital ownership. They have seen a 100x increase in transaction volume in the last 6 months. By late April 2021, OpenSea had more than 100,000 users who had traded at least once.

Inspired by the CryptoPunk project, the Ethereum community started the discussion and drafting of the NFT standard in the second half of 2017, and wrote the first draft and the second draft on September 20 and November 9, respectively. By January 24, 2018, William Entriken and others from the Ethereum community jointly completed the first NFT standard on Ethereum, ERC-721. since then, NFT technology was officially born. CryptoKitties, a cat-themed blockchain game that was unveiled at the Ethereum Waterloo Hackathon on October 19, 2017, is widely considered to be the first NFT project to adopt the ERC-721 standard.

In October 2020, American digital artist Mike Winkelmann, who goes by the stage name beeple, debuted his crypto artwork at auction on the well-known NFT auction site Nifty Gateway. Prior to that, he had been quietly and consistently creating digital artworks on a daily basis for nearly 14 years. Nifty Gateway added nine extra servers to handle the surge in traffic so the site didn't crash. Within five minutes, the sale was up to $582,000.

In December's auction, beeple's work earned $3.5 million from the sale, with an additional $500,000 from the secondary market. beeple receives 90 percent of the proceeds from primary sales and an additional 10 percent from secondary sales. the December auction was just 20 pieces of Beeple's 13-year "Everydays" series.

From February 25 to March 11, 2021, Christie's, the world's leading art auction house, opened its online auction for beeple's NFT "Everydays: The First 5000 Days". The work, which was assembled from 5,000 images, is an artistic NFT by beeple commemorating the 5,000 days he continued to create one work a day since May 1, 2007. The work was sold for a staggering $69,346,500, which established beeple as the number one encrypted artist on the NFT list.

On May 11, 2021, nine CryptoPunk NFTs sold for a whopping $16,962,500 at Christie's Evening Sale, and on June 10, 2021, CryptoPunk #7523 successfully sold for a record $1,175.4 at Sotheby's, the world's leading art auction house. #7523 became the most expensive CryptoPunk ever sold.

The success of NFT artworks in the world's top auction houses and the succession of record sales is not just the success of one series of works by beeple personally or CryptoPunks, but a sign that the whole NFT market is moving towards the mainstream, being accepted by more people with big capital, social status and significant influence, and being noticed and favored by Wall Street and public companies.

## Metaverse Enlightenment

In late 2017, after playing CryptoKitties for a few months, Trung Nguyen, a 25-year-old Vietnamese programmer, had the idea to develop his own blockchain game, taking elements of CryptoKitties' success, such as real ownership, an advanced genetic system, and adding more competitive Pokémon or Neopets-like gameplay. A few months later, Axie Infinity was born, and in mid-2018, the beta version was launched. Unlike many projects that require funding, Axie Infinity started with enough money to sustain the developers for a full year by pre-selling Axies NFT.

From April-June 2021, Axie Infinity experienced explosive growth with the launch of the exclusive Ethereum sidechain Ronin, the release of the "Play to Earn" documentary, and the breaking of the million pokemon count mark. Daily active users (DAUs) jumped from 38,000 at the end of April to 252,000 (most of the new users came from the Philippines and Venezuela), and total community vault revenue grew from less than $1 million in about two months to more than $14 million at the end of June. By the end of the year, the Community Vault is expected to have 15.6 million AXS and 26,600,000 ETH, which translates to about $300 million in current prices. These assets can be distributed by AXS token holders' governance decisions on how to divide them up, spend them or by pledging them for mining.

More importantly, Axie Infinity is also a very positive narrative. Axie Infinity offers an unprecedented opportunity to earn money for a large number of players from third world countries such as the Philippines, Indonesia and Venezuela, who are unemployed and at home due to the new epidemic and in financial distress, and who need to feed themselves without leaving their homes. Axie Infinity is leading the "play to earn" revolution and has been hailed as a metaverse gaming success story by the industry.

The concept of metaverse has largely remained at the level of imagination since its introduction, while the maturity of blockchain has paved the way for its landing, and the untimely arrival of the epidemic era has put it on the fast track. In the post-epidemic era, a large part of people's abruptly changed lifestyles will be fixed and become the new normal and habit. Scenes and activities that were moved online may no longer return offline, and people's living space, time and money will increasingly be done online. Common sense will change, perceptions will change, and a new social consensus will be born. This new consensus is that the virtual world is not false and unimportant, but a new state of human existence. In this new state of existence, business, as an important part of human civilization's activities, will inevitably become one of the core tracks in the metaverse.
