During the Renaissance period of the 14th-16th centuries, Venice was a very important commercial and artistic center of Europe. In 1494, the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli, a close friend of the famous painter Leonardo da Vinci, published in Venice a textbook on mathematics, "Summary of Arithmetic, Geometry, Proportions and Proportionality". In this book, Pacioli elaborated for the first time on double-entry bookkeeping, for which he is honored as the "father of modern accounting". It was with advanced double-entry bookkeeping techniques that the modern corporate system was established, and the geographic discoveries of the late 15th century brought unprecedented commercial prosperity to Europe.

In the 1860s, the capitalist production in Britain began to replace the factory handicraft industry with the rapid development of productivity, and this process is called the "Industrial Revolution" in history. At the end of the 18th century, the Industrial Revolution gradually spread from England to Western Europe and North America. Later, it gradually expanded to other parts of the world. After the Industrial Revolution, the entire capitalist and market economy flourished, and new and high technology was applied to globalized production and trade, which has created great wealth for all mankind to this day.

Today, we are at the turning point of the leap from material civilization to digital civilization. The digital civilization and the new business civilization, carried by digital, located in the bit world, are coming.

## Bartering

Before the birth of commercial trade, with the slow increase in productivity, the need for exchange naturally arose if there was a rich portion of the products obtained by people's productive labor. This primitive exchange, because of the need for double contingency, and thus the transaction is very inefficient.

The bartering process is different from commercial buying and selling in that no money or currency is used as the instrument of exchange, and therefore there is no credit problem.

## Traditional Retail

With the development of human civilization, the expansion of social activities, the further increase of productivity, and the birth of commerce, man invented money and extended the borders of commercial trade to the whole world.

The expansion of commercial activities and globalized trade led to the unprecedented development of industry and commerce, bringing about a great abundance of commodities. With this great abundance of commodities, retailing flourished. Merchants integrated and linked global supply chains to sell goods produced in any corner of the earth to another far-flung corner of the world.

## E-commerce

The predecessor of the Internet can be traced back to the ARPANET launched in 1969 by the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the U.S. Department of Defense. In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee, the "father of the World Wide Web," proposed the idea of the World Wide Web and developed the world's first Web browser. The Internet began to become an information service that was accessible to everyone and free of charge.

The first wave of the Internet in the 1990s saw the birth of many dazzling Internet companies, including Amazon, today's world-famous e-commerce platform, which was founded by Jeff Bezos on July 5, 1994, in his garage in Bellevue, Washington, the fifth largest city in the United States. Today, Amazon has grown to become one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, and Bezos was once the richest man in the world because of his massive Amazon stock holdings.

However, the e-commerce platforms that have become giants themselves are still built on the centralized technology and protocols of the traditional Internet. While users enjoy the convenience brought by these traditional Internet platforms and centralized protocols, they also have to give up their data sovereignty and personal privacy due to the nature of their centralized control, allowing these platforms to collect and use their personal privacy data at will.

Today, Internet commerce and e-commerce ecosystem are at the turning point of the times. According to Charles Handy's The Second Curve theory, Internet e-commerce is now at the peak of the first curve, and it is downhill from there. At this point the industry needs disruptive changes to find the second curve and create a new technological framework, a new asset paradigm and a new business civilization.

This new technological framework is blockchain technology with decentralized protocols as the cornerstone. This new asset paradigm is the digital asset built on blockchain technology, which is native to bits. The new business civilization is a metaverse of digital assets, decentralized applications, and a global ecosystem that is on the ground and thriving. We call it Metaverse Commerce.
