Today, the boundaries of human economic activities have expanded from the traditional physical world and atomic world to the information world and digital world, and even to the metaverse being bred and formed. Social, entertainment, game and business are all landed and flourished in an interconnected and long-lasting metaverse, evolving a new form of digital economy.

Before the birth of blockchain technology, information on the Internet could only be information, but could not be an "asset". Since information on the Internet can be copied at will at nearly zero cost, it does not have any scarcity and therefore cannot have any economic value of its own, and therefore cannot be an asset.

Blockchain technology imparts irreproducibility to digital entities, thus giving them scarcity and value in the economic sense, and thus making digital assets possible for the first time in human history. This digital asset, instead of being just a reference to a physical asset in some atomic world, has an original value on the blockchain. For this reason, we also refer to this digital asset with its inherent scarcity and economic value as a bit-native asset.

The original bit-native assets were homogeneous or fungible (fungible). Typical representatives are various cryptocurrencies, and tokens or pass-throughs (tokens), such as the ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, or the NRC-6 token on NewChain.

As the industry has evolved, non-homogeneous, or so-called non-fungible (non-fungible) bit-native assets have been defined. Typical representatives are NFT (Non-Fungible Token), such as the ERC-721 token on the Ethereum blockchain, or the NRC-7 token on NewChain.

With blockchain technology and bit-native assets, Metaverse Commerce protocols can be built on this basis to create a new business paradigm. Bit commodities, represented by NFT, are a natural fit with Metaverse Commerce protocols. Therefore, we will see the success of CryptoPunk, the recognition of beeple's artworks by traditional auction houses, and the gradual introduction of digital assets represented by NFT to the mainstream public and high-end people. This series of new business paradigms will all shine in the metaverse. Metaverse provides the best landing environment for the new business civilization in the digital era, realizes the global borderless common participation, co-creation and common governance, and lays a solid foundation for the new digital immigrants all over the world to build a new commerce ecosystem in the metaverse together.

The future is here, and the combination and innovation of NFT, blockchain technology and metaverse will play an important enabling role in the colorful and personalized scenarios of digital art, online business, IP digitization and assetization, creating huge business value and economic benefits.

## Digital Tribes

In metaverse, with the development of technology, influx of users and economic boom, self-organized "real" digital tribes will evolve and form around related topics in the dimensions of interests, hobbies and industries. Typical examples include Axie Infinity, Decentraland, and Sandbox.

Metaverse digital tribes are fundamentally different from traditional Internet communities and circles. The latter are purely virtual information and accounts, while the former are assets and avatars that have the same enduring existence as physical reality. Among these digital tribes born in the metaverse, the empowerment of open infrastructures such as blockchain technology allows for extensive and durable interconnection and interoperability at the level of experiences and assets.

The license-free nature of blockchain and the free flow of digital assets are particularly well suited for economic empowerment and drive in digital tribes. Blockchain and the pass-through economy are naturally decentralized and private domain. On the blockchain, each user owns the property rights of his own data sovereignty and private domain traffic, which is ensured by blockchain technology to be authentic and valid, and will not be deprived or tampered by any third party at will. Thus, it provides the best soil for the prosperity of digital tribes.

## Digital Assets

With open standards such as ERC-721 or ERC-1155 on Ethereum, or NRC-7 or NRC-50 on NewChain, users can actually own a whole new type of digital item, such as a CryptoPunk, or a piece of art from beeple. We can think of this brand new digital item as a digital asset, or as a bit commodity.

The assetization of data is an irreversible trend, and the digitization, programmability, and assetization of IP is also in the process of rapid development. We can see not only various digital assets, but also a wide variety of bit goods including digital artworks. The native value of digital assets and bit goods can be transmitted over long distances, at low cost, and in near real-time via the Internet with the help of blockchain, much faster and cheaper than transporting physical assets and goods, with little time and space constraints and artificial controls.

The change from physical goods to bit goods is disruptive and revolutionary, and as a result, traditional e-commerce is bound to be replaced by a new metaverse of commerce. This change will have a profound impact on human business civilization and social life.

### Native Bits Goods

Native bit goods have only a digital form and no physical form, and their existence, uniqueness, and validity are proven by the blockchain. As a result, the value of native bit goods is also native to the bit world.

In the case of a crypto-collectible CryptoPunk, or a crypto artwork such as a piece of beeple, for example, a native bit commodity consists of two organic parts: the first part is the collection or artwork itself in digital form, in media such as images, audio and video, etc.; the second part is an NFT non-homogenized token located on the blockchain, in which an immutable hash pointer is used to reference the corresponding digital collectibles or artworks. The former provides appreciation and collection value, while the latter acts as a value carrier, providing economic value and exchangeability.

### Redeemable Bit Goods

Redeemable Bit Commodity is a mapping of on-chain pass (token) and physical world valuable assets using NFT and IoT technologies, thus completing the chain of physical world valuable assets. The value of the commodity still exists in the physical world under the chain, but after the NFT is on the chain, it can effectively increase the transparency and effectiveness of social resources.

For example, for industries such as tide play and luxury goods, the use of convertible NFT technology for up-chaining can effectively improve product authenticity guarantee and enhance inventory transparency and credibility. In organic agriculture, the technology can be used in combination with IoT technology for traceability of agricultural products to achieve one NFT for one thing and full chain tracking of production and marketing. real-time data collected by IoT devices are updated to the blockchain through prophecy machine (Oracle) technology to achieve automated synchronized tracking of data on and off the chain.

After consumers purchase redeemable NFT goods, they can complete the off-chain logistics of physical goods and obtain the corresponding goods through the redemption operation. After the redemption is completed, the on-chain NFT will change its status to avoid repeated redemptions.

### Ownership and Durability

The digitization of assets and blockchain technology empowers users to directly own, control and manipulate their assets. The user's ownership of digital assets on the blockchain is ensured by cryptographic technology and is not restricted by or dependent on any third-party institution to exercise the retention, control and transfer of the assets.

Due to the global interconnectivity of blockchain without the need for permission, digital assets located on the blockchain can circulate and trade freely around the world without any liquidity borders or barriers. For example, transferring a beeple's NFT artwork from a Christie's auction to the auctioneer's crypto wallet requires only a small up-chain fee and can be done in a matter of minutes. In contrast, if a world-famous painting, such as Van Gogh's Sunflowers, were to be transported from the Christie's auction site to the American buyer, the transportation costs, security costs, insurance costs, and time costs, among others, would be far greater than the remote transfer of digital assets.

A very important feature of the metaverse is the persistence of digital assets. Relying on blockchain and other infrastructures, the original virtual goods are able to get rid of the control of third-party centralized companies or platforms, and will not disappear due to the collapse of centralized companies, but will exist forever. It is this characteristic, which is absolutely different from the traditional information Internet, that makes the metaverse the soil and environment where digital assets can truly exist.

## Digital Economy

It is a historic opportunity given by the times to join the metaverse and participate in the groundbreaking digital economy and new business civilization.

The native transaction method rooted in the metaverse has lower transaction costs, digital assets and digital goods circulate freely in the metaverse without the restrictions of geographical distance and artificial boundaries in the real world, breaking the traditional boundaries of space and time, greatly liberating production relations, releasing huge productivity, and creating a metaverse economy tens of thousands of times larger than the Internet economy.

Metaverse Commerce is built on top of a decentralized blockchain infrastructure, and the peer-to-peer nature of the protocol eliminates traditional centralized platforms, thus greatly reducing transaction costs.

Decentralization is a more efficient trust mechanism reached by consensus. Traditional centralized models increase transaction costs and proliferate requirements for private data and trust due to the reliance on centralized platforms, thus reducing the business efficiency of the entire system. In contrast, the metaverse native decentralized model eliminates the reliance on traditional centralized platforms, reduces transaction costs, decreases the requirement for privacy data and trust, and improves the business efficiency of the entire system.

### Empowering individuals and SMEs

Blockchain, digital assets and Metaverse Commerce are the most powerful tools and instruments to empower individuals and SMEs. With the help of blockchain technology, anyone can create their own metaverse commerce body very simply and easily as well as inexpensively.

In Metaverse Commerce, commercial entities can rely on blockchain technology for the digital assetization of points. Unlike the traditional Internet database points, blockchain passes or points issued on the blockchain are real digital assets that can achieve total scarcity, non-tamperability, public witness, global trading and open access.

Metaverse can provide actual business scenarios for business entities to circulate passes: by combining blockchain passes or points into specific business scenarios of private domain traffic, and presenting, using and circulating them through user interface technologies such as DApp (H5), applets and even AR/VR, the passes or points are given actual business value.
