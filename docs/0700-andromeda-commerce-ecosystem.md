Based on the Newton metaverse infrastructure, and the Andromeda metaverse commerce protocol, a new metaverse commerce ecosystem can be established by combining various metaverse applications.

No matter how the scene changes, how the platform is upgraded, from the traditional physical world, to the Internet information world, and then to the metaverse digital world, business is always a vital core part of an economy.

Any application scenario and track, whether it is gaming, entertainment, social, fashion, collection, or art, is bound to have a derivative demand for commercial activities. All activities are accompanied by the birth and transaction of assets. The only difference is that in the metaverse, all assets are digital assets and all transactions are point-to-point transactions on the blockchain.

As a result, all the series of business activities around the digital assets in the metaverse constitute the unique metaverse commerce ecosystem - Andromeda Commerce Ecosystem.
