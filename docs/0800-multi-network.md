There are multidimensional spaces in the universe, and different spaces require wormholes to traverse. In the Andromeda universe, the default space-time is based on NewChain, but can be transported to other chains such as Ethereum, HecoChain or BSC through the NewBridge protocol.

Blockchains are interoperable and independent of each other, and the NewBridge protocol can link the independent chains, increasing the activity of Newton's native token and increasing the user base of the Andromeda metaverse.

## Technology Implementation

The multi-network technology implementation is mainly based on NewBridge protocol. NewBrdige is the cross-chain mechanism of Newton NewChain, which realizes the parallel transmission of value between Newton and other mainstream public chains, maximizes the use of NewChain's advantages such as low cost, speed block and low operation threshold, and improves asset liquidity.

The NewBridge protocol supports NRC/ERC-20, NRC-7/ERC-721 and NRC-50/ERC-1155 tokens across chains, and when it supports a token, it creates shadow tokens on different chains that have the basic functions of the native token and can participate in each chain's respective The token has the basic functions of the native token and can participate in each chain's respective ecosystem.

NewBridge contains Core, SecureVault, Monitor and API, where Core ensures the main logic of NewBridge protocol; SecureVault keeps the coins supported by NewBridge and controls the in/out of the system; Monitor is the monitor of each blockchain, which needs to be adapted for different Monitor is the monitor of each blockchain, which needs to be adapted for different chains and monitors the operation status of each chain; API is the interface provided by NewBridge system to the outside world, which is convenient for the third party DAPP to access and cross-chain freely.

NewBridge protocol users need to specify the chain to be received, the acceptance address, the coin contract, the number of coins, and other basic information, and transfer the coins to be cross-chained into the NewBridge protocol, pay the cross-chain fee, and then receive the cross-chain past token at the address specified on the corresponding chain.

At the same time, the NewOracle protocol provides interoperability and reporting of various types of information between networks and outside the network, and is the perceptual nervous system of the metaverse.
