AND DAO is Andromeda Decentralized Autonomous Organization, the governing organization of the Andromeda Protocol, which is composed of all AND holders.

During the launch phase, the Andromeda Foundation will be established to coordinate and lead various efforts in R&D, operations, business cooperation, pass design and exchange.

As the project unfolds and matures, the work coordinated and led by the Foundation will be transferred to AND DAO in an orderly manner, realizing the decentralization of the entire Andromeda metaverse.

AND DAO achieves democratic autonomy for all AND holders through an effective on-chain voting governance mechanism. It includes a series of governance procedures such as proposal, discussion, polling, voting, etc., to realize the use of financial treasury, R&D decision, product adjustment, arbitration of on-chain affairs, operational growth, etc.

Towards DAO, let Andromeda metaverse business governance towards distributed business and shared governance, realizing the common construction, sharing and governance of Andromeda metaverse.

## Governance

AND DAO's governance system includes several infrastructures as follows:

1. AND token contract with built-in governance protocol and authorization mechanism
2. the Governance contract, which is responsible for managing governance proposals and voting
3. Timelock contract, which delays the execution of on-chain actions such as moving community treasury
4. Community Treasury contract, responsible for locking the community treasury
5. Governance forum for users to discuss governance issues
6. Off-chain voting site, which completes the necessary steps such as polling and consensus checking before the official on-chain voting
7. Formal governance portal for all AND holders to vote on-chain according to the one-coin-one-vote principle

The governance process is as follows:

1. Forum discussion stage
2. Temperature check stage
3. Consensus check stage
4. Formal proposal stage
5. Proposal implementation stage

## Arbitration

It is used to resolve potential dispute issues that may arise in exchange, etc.

The Andromeda arbitration node will undertake the adjudication of disputes throughout the distributed economic activity, and the arbitration fee is charged at 2% of the transaction amount and distributed to the nodes involved in the arbitration.

Due to the special nature of NFT transactions, the transaction is closed when the transaction is completed. Disputes can only arise in the exchange link of redeemable NFT, for example, a user purchases a box of redeemable fresh food, there is a problem in the delivery link of the merchant, and the transaction is double-deadlocked. At this point either party to the transaction can apply to the Arbitration Committee for arbitration. We will ensure that the dispute is decided fairly and justly through a set of arbitration agreements.

After arbitration is initiated, the arbitration contract will automatically host the transaction deposit in the distributed credit, and according to the size of the transaction subject, the contract automatically selects the arbitration node to participate in the voting arbitration, and the arbitration node will vote on the award based on the transaction behavior and the information of proof that occurred between the two parties on the chain, and the award will be final at the moment. The cost of each award is charged at 2% of the transaction amount, and the cost is automatically deducted from the pledge of the losing party.

## Growth

Traffic is getting more and more expensive and difficult to convert, and it is difficult to meet the efficient growth of existing business activities with simple traffic acquisition. The Andromeda pass-through economic model allows for the rapid establishment of transaction nodes, growth nodes, and arbitration nodes.

Growth nodes and arbitration nodes need to have NFT identity cards and lock a fixed number of ANDs to participate in the common governance of the economy, such as the update of the Metaverse commerce protocol and the incentive management of Andromeda points.

Trading nodes can carry out their own business activities and private domain marketing through the solution provided by Andromeda. The idea of trading nodes getting traffic changes to using Andromeda's economic model to get more loyal users, each user of the node is a private domain fan, the nodes themselves master their own operational data, and business activities are not coerced by the centralized platform.

Andromeda offers the simplicity of generating transaction nodes with a single click, providing differentiated services and solutions for different levels of transaction nodes.

By transforming the centralized protocol into a decentralized protocol, "ecological partners" and entrepreneurs are recruited to become "NewTrade nodes" and use various tools and solutions in the NewTrade ecosystem to build their own business platform, promote and sell Andromeda solution solutions, and earn commissions through the agent sales system.
