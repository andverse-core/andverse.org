Synthetic commodities are a combination of multiple NFTs to create a new NFT, which allows the NFT holder to program, recreate, and add some useful functionality to the NFT digital assets they hold. It can be used in the field of digital artwork signature, business contract signing, etc. The NFT holder licenses its NFT to a specific contract and locks it, inviting other NFT holders to recreate the NFT, casting a NFT digital asset with new characteristics.
